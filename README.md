# Plotly_deployment
The purpose of this project to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer and allow volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This will help Improbable Beef to identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. At the same time Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
In order to perform the analysis, we have built:
## A Horizontal Bar Chart to display the top 10 bacteria Cultures Found
 
## A Bubble Chart to display the Bacteria Cultures Per Sample 
 
## Gauge Chart to display the Belly Button Washing Frequency
